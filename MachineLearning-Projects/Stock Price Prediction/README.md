# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

A machine learning web application that predicts stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Built with Streamlit for an interactive user interface and powered by deep learning techniques for time series forecasting.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Stock Data**: Fetches live stock data using Yahoo Finance API
- **Advanced Technical Indicators**: Incorporates multiple technical analysis indicators including:
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Daily Returns and Log Returns
  - Momentum and Volatility indicators
- **LSTM Neural Network**: Deep learning model for time series prediction
- **10-Day Price Forecasting**: Predicts stock prices for the next 10 days
- **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic charts using Plotly
- **Model Caching**: Efficient model storage to avoid retraining
- **Multiple Stock Support**: Pre-configured with popular stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, AMZN)

## üìä Supported Stocks

- **AAPL** - Apple Inc.
- **MSFT** - Microsoft Corporation
- **GOOGL** - Alphabet Inc.
- **TSLA** - Tesla Inc.
- **AMZN** - Amazon.com Inc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

## üß† Model Architecture

The LSTM model consists of:

- **Input Layer**: 60 time steps of historical stock data
- **LSTM Layer 1**: 50 units with return sequences
- **LSTM Layer 2**: 50 units without return sequences
- **Dense Layer 1**: 25 neurons
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron for price prediction

### Technical Indicators Used

1. **SMA (50-day)**: Simple Moving Average for trend analysis
2. **EMA (50-day)**: Exponential Moving Average for recent price emphasis
3. **RSI (14-day)**: Relative Strength Index for momentum analysis
4. **Bollinger Bands**: Upper, Middle, and Lower bands for volatility analysis
5. **Momentum (4-day)**: Price momentum indicator
6. **Volatility (21-day)**: Rolling standard deviation

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: Retrieves 5 years of historical stock data from Yahoo Finance
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculates technical indicators and preprocessing
3. **Data Normalization**: Scales data using MinMaxScaler for optimal neural network performance
4. **Sequence Preparation**: Creates 60-day sequences for LSTM input
5. **Model Training**: Trains LSTM network with 80/20 train-test split
6. **Prediction**: Generates 10-day forward predictions
7. **Visualization**: Displays results with interactive Plotly charts

## üìà Usage

1. **Select Stock**: Choose from the dropdown menu of available stocks
2. **View Current Price**: See the latest stock price
3. **Train & Predict**: Click the button to train the model and generate predictions
4. **View Results**: Examine the predicted prices table and interactive chart

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Model Caching**: Models are cached to improve performance on repeated predictions
- **Training Time**: Initial model training may take a few minutes
- **Data Dependency**: Predictions depend on historical data quality and market conditions
- **No Financial Advice**: This tool is for educational purposes only and should not be used for actual trading decisions

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Stocks

To add new stocks, modify the `stock_list` in `app.py`:

```python
stock_list = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'YOUR_STOCK_SYMBOL']
```

### Adjusting Prediction Period

To change the prediction timeframe, modify the range in the prediction loop:

```python
for day in range(10):  # Change 10 to desired number of days
```

### Model Hyperparameters

Key parameters that can be tuned:

- `time_steps=60`: Historical data window
- `epochs=5`: Training iterations
- `batch_size=32`: Training batch size
- LSTM units: Currently set to 50 for both layers

## üìù Model Performance

The model displays training loss as a performance metric. Lower loss values indicate better model performance on the test dataset.

## ü§ù Contributing

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

- Models are cached automatically to avoid retraining
- Close unnecessary browser tabs when running to optimize memory usage
- For better predictions, ensure stable internet connection for data fetching

## üîç Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Data Fetching Issues**: Check internet connection and Yahoo Finance API availability
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size or number of LSTM units if experiencing memory problems
4. **Slow Performance**: Consider reducing the number of epochs or using a smaller time window
